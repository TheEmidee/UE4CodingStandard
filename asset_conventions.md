# Asset Conventions

Naming conventions should be treated as law. A project that conforms to a naming convention is able to have its assets managed, searched, parsed, and maintained with incredible ease.

Most things are prefixed with prefixes being generally an acronym of the asset type followed by an underscore.

## [ac.nospace]

Don't use spaces in the asset or folder names. It can create harder than necessary access to the assets, especially if using command line tools.

## [ac.noaccents]

Don't use accentuated or unicode characters in the asset or folder names.

## [ac.asset.naming]

All assets should follow the convention `Prefix_BaseAssetName_Variant_Suffix`
